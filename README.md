# Background_Subtraction
Detect change in frame of a video

# Problem Statement was To detect a Car chase scene is happening or not

If Camera is moving/still relative to car then to detect if car is moving or not I came with idea of background subtraction
I have taken differnece of 10 frame from the video if both are not same then it will print "car chase scene" otherwise "not a chase scene"

For Further look into the source code...
